# Customer-segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis
This project utilizes RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to perform customer segmentation for an eCommerce dataset. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behaviors, which can then inform targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and ultimately enhance profitability.
